        <h1> Alex Davis </h1>
        <p><strong>My name is Alex!</strong></p> 
        <p>I am going into my senior year at CU majoring in <em>Geography</em> with a minor in <em>Creative Technology & Design</em>.
            Some of my hobbies include playing and competeing in video games; specifically FPS games like Call of Duty and Valorant,
            reading/watching anime/manga, listening to music, and snowboarding. </p>
        <p> My goals for this course include gaining an understanding of websites and the web making processes. I have never worked 
            with HTML, CSS, or JS outside of Computational Foundations, so I am excited to learn more about it.  </p>
